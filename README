This library provides programmatic access to the Pivotal API using .net.  Eventually, all the Pivotal APIs will be implemented, but for now it is just the most commonly used items.
NOTE: This started as an enhancement to a project on google code, but it ended up being an overhaul.  However, there are still some remnants of that original code, so credit needs to be given to the author: http://code.google.com/p/pivotal-tracker-api/ 

To Do:
- Write tests
- More CRUD operations
  - Project: Update, Delete(?)
  - Membership: Update, Delete, Add
  - Iterations: (not implemented at all)
  - Stories: Pagination, Deliver, Move, External Integrations, Attachments
